# Real-Time Face Detection using Tiny Faces in PyTorch

This repository implements the [Tiny Faces in PyTorch](https://github.com/varunagrawal/tiny-faces-pytorch) framework, with the encoder architecture modified to use ResNet50 instead of ResNet101, for real-time face detection.

## Getting Started
* 
* Download the [WIDER FACE](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/) dataset and unzip data and annotation files to data/widerface such that :
~~~
$ ls data/widerface
wider_face_test.mat   wider_face_train.mat    wider_face_val.mat
WIDER_test/           WIDER_train/            WIDER_val/
~~~
