## Real-Time Face Detection using Tiny Faces in PyTorch

This repository implements a modified version of the [Tiny Faces in PyTorch](https://github.com/varunagrawal/tiny-faces-pytorch) framework for real-time face detection. The encoder architecture has been updated to use ResNet50 instead of ResNet101.
